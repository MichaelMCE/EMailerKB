Amstrad Emailer Pinouts
-----------------------

Looking at top of keyboard, with the keys facing towards you. Pin 1 is 
leftmost.

PIN	SIGNAL	WIRE	
1 	GND 	black/shield	(connected to metal plate on keyboard)
2 	DATA 	green
3 	CLOCK 	red
4 	+5V 	blue		(3.3V works fine)

Notes
-----

* Standard PC keyboard protocol with non standard scan codes.
* When the bus is idle, clock and data lines are high.
* The data line should be sampled on the rising edge of the clock pulse.
* Data bytes are transmitted as follows:

  START=0
  D0
  D1
  D2
  D3
  D4
  D5
  D6
  D7
  PARITY (odd)
  STOP=1


Note that when a key is pressed, the scan code is sent as a single byte. When
the key is released it is transmitted as two bytes, first the prefix of 0xf0
followed by the scan code itself.
